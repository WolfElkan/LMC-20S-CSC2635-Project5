# Project 5 – Advanced User Interfaces
*CSC2635 Computer Science II*

## Objective

Be able to write a program in Java that implements **Advanced user interface**-based concepts such as layouts, menus, selection-based components *(radio buttons, comboboxes, etc,..)*, mouse events, etc..

## Instructions
1.	You may, if you’d like, select a partner (makes the design/creative component more fun).
2.	Review topic based [materials](#related-materials-readings-videos-etc)
3.	Select **a project idea** from the section on [project options](#project-options). 
4.	Review the **rubric** on **Canvas** so you understand how your solution will be evaluated. 
5.	**Implement** your solution in Java using the IDE of your choice.  If your project is well-designed then implementation should be easy
6.	**Test, test, test!!!**
7.	Write a [summary](#summary)
8.	[Submit](#submitting-your-work)
9.	**Demonstrate** your running program to instructor. Be prepared to show all possible test cases and answer project-related questions.
